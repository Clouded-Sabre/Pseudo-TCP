CLIENT AUTO-RECONNECT FEATURE - DOCUMENTATION RESTRUCTURED
===========================================================

WHAT CHANGED:
From: 1 large IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (550 lines)
To:   4 focused documents (~1600 lines total)

NEW STRUCTURE:
==============

1. DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md (5.7K)
   └─ Quick navigation guide
   └─ Tells you which document to read based on your role
   └─ READ THIS FIRST to navigate to what you need

2. CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (16K)
   └─ For: Developers implementing client applications
   └─ Contains: Step-by-step guide, code examples, patterns, testing
   └─ Read if: You're building a client using the reconnection feature

3. CLIENT_RECONNECT_DESIGN.md (14K)
   └─ For: Architects understanding the design
   └─ Contains: Architecture, design philosophy, why decisions were made
   └─ Read if: You want to understand the "why" behind the implementation

4. BUGS_AND_FIXES.md (14K)
   └─ For: Future development and maintenance
   └─ Contains: Issues discovered, root causes, fixes applied, lessons
   └─ Read if: You encounter issues or want to prevent similar problems

WHY THIS STRUCTURE:
===================

✅ Clear Separation of Concerns
   - Design vs Implementation vs Reference
   - Each document has one clear purpose

✅ Better Navigation  
   - DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md tells you where to go
   - No need to read everything to find what you need

✅ Easier to Maintain
   - Changes to implementation don't require updating design docs
   - Reference section is separate from "how to" sections

✅ Suitable for Different Audiences
   - Implementers: CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
   - Architects: CLIENT_RECONNECT_DESIGN.md  
   - Maintainers: BUGS_AND_FIXES.md

QUICK START:
============

1. Go to DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
2. Find your role (implementer, architect, or maintainer)
3. Jump to the appropriate document
4. Follow the guidance there

FEATURE STATUS:
===============

✅ Production Ready
✅ All critical issues fixed
✅ Comprehensive documentation
✅ Working example (test/echoclient/main.go)
✅ All race conditions addressed

FILES INCLUDED:
===============

Documentation:
  - DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md     Navigation guide
  - CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md   How to implement
  - CLIENT_RECONNECT_DESIGN.md       Why it's designed this way
  - BUGS_AND_FIXES.md          Reference of issues & fixes
  - README.md                  Project root

Code:
  - lib/client_reconnector.go  Reconnection helper (189 lines)
  - lib/connection.go          Modified with defensive checks
  - lib/pcpcore.go             Modified with protocol recovery
  - test/echoclient/main.go    Example client (190 lines)

TOTAL DOCUMENTATION: 1600 lines across 4 focused documents
OLD APPROACH: 550 lines in 1 monolithic document
